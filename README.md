## Splitt3r

Splitt3r takes a list (text file for example) as its input and outputs the data as CSV with a column count of your choosing. It can also deduplicate that data for you. This makes it easy to split lists into columns of equal value, which can then be pasted into other tools such as Word.

### Usage
Example1: _./splitt3r.rb --columns 8 –data /path/to/listofips.txt_  
Example2: _./splitt3r.rb --columns 8 –data /path/to/listofips.txt --uniq_ (Removes duplicates from your list)
